/*
21. In a university, a University has multiple Departments. Define a University class that aggregates multiple Department objects. Each department has properties like name, facultyCount, and headOfDepartment. The university "has" departments, but departments can exist independently.
Note: The University aggregates Department objects, where the departments are part of the university but exist independently (e.g., a department might be transferred or merged with another university).
